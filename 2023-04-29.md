9:00 am to 1:00 pm Pacific

## Agenda
* Semester reflection
* Final session overview
* Open lab work time
* Open Q&A

## Semester reflection
What went well? What didn't? How can I improve for the next time I teach this class?

## Final session overview
Python-based lab exercise to reinforce what you've learned this semester. 
* The lab will be roughly the length of 1-1.5 labs and worth 20 points (roughly two labs). 
* The lab will also include a few more challenging, optional extra credit opportunities.

Each lab is an individual submission, so please complete all work by yourself. 
* You can reference your previous lab submissions to help you complete tasks, but I'll include code to help you out. 

I strongly encourage you to try and solve or complete the optional extra credit opportunities. Trying (even if you think/know its wrong) is worth at least a bit of credit, i.e. I'm pretty generous when it comes to grading.

The lab is due before the end of class on May 6, 2023 1pm Pacific. Any submissions after that time are technically late, so one point will be deducted per day late.

## Open lab work time
Get caught up on any unsubmitted labs

## Open Q&A
About lab exercise, the rest of the course, or general career stuff
