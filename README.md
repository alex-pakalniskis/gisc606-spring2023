# GISC 606 - Applied Remote Sensing

Spring 2023

Standard Course Outline prepared by Drs. S. Wechsler, C. Lee and V. Del Casino for California State University, Long Beach College of Liberal Arts, Department of Geography. Adapted for web (and slightly modified) by Alex Pakalniskis.

## Justification
Spatial information technologies including remote sensing are evolving rapidly and are being utilized in a wide variety of areas. This course focuses on analytical approaches within remote sensing and GIS. The course culminates in combining these technical and analytical skills with critical thinking and interpersonal communication through the development and presentation of a research project. The course contributes to the development of competencies that are essential to success in the geospatial workforce.

## Course Objectives and Measurable Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

| Focus | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| Technical | Identify and assess relationships between geospatial technologies. | 
| Technical |  Comprehend theory and the application of geospatial technologies. |
| Technical | Develop technical literacy through hands-on training in geospatial technologies and their application. | 
| Technical | Integrate primary and secondary data into GIS. | 
| Technical |  Perform various spatial analysis procedures. | 
| Technical | Acquire theoretical and practical knowledge of remote sensing satellites and techniques. |
| Technical |  Describe types and sources of satellites remote sensing systems, and multidisciplinary concepts of both photography and imagery analysis. |
| Technical |  Demonstrate an appreciation of the role of remote sensing in geospatial science. |
| Technical |  Integrate remotely sensed data with other geospatial techniques such as GIS |
| Analytical | Evaluate methods and approaches used to address a variety of GIScientific issues. |
| Analytical | Examine a spatial question and analyze geospatial data using GIS tools and technologies. |
| Analytical | Perform analyses using remote sensing and image analysis techniques. |
| Analytical | Assess both the value and limitations of remotely sensed data for a variety of applications. |
| Business | Explain and evaluate the importance of professional ethics and rules of conduct. |
| Interpersonal | Develop and apply oral and written communication skills. |

## Methods of Instruction
Lecture
* Lectures will be comprised of two components:
    * the presentation of theoretical and conceptual material essential to the understanding of particular geospatial techniques
    * the linkage of this substantive information with practical application examples using GIS software

Computer Laboratory Exercises
* Computer laboratory assignments will reinforce the linkage beween substantive background and practical application of techniques

## Methods of Assessment
Computer Laboratory Exercises
* The purpose of these exercises is to assess the students' ability to synthesize and evaluate the material presented in lecture and applied in practice laboratory assignments in order to combine multiple techniques in order to answer a spatial problem.
* The instructor assess the completeness of each student's lab assignments, in-class assignments, and term projects in both qualitative and quantitative ways.
* A minimum of 5 computer lab exercises will be assigned. No individual lab assignment shall be worth more than one-third of the final course grade.

Project
* The instructor will require students to demonstrate mastery of remote sensing concepts and skills by developing a project that applies remote sensing techniques to address a spatial problem. 
* The instructor will assess the project in terms of its creativeness, appropriateness of themes, data collection and preparation, methodology, skill, and oral and written communication of results to evaluate whether the student successfully demonstrates practical application of the topics learned. 
* The final project shall consist of a written and oral submission. 
* No one component of the project shall be worth more than one-third of the final course grade.
