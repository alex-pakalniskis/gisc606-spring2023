# GISC 606 - Applied Remote Sensing Syllabus

Lecturer: [Alex Pakalniskis](https://alex-pakalniskis.github.io/)

## Justification
Spatial information technologies including remote sensing are evolving rapidly and are being utilized in a wide variety of areas. This course focuses on analytical approaches within remote sensing and GIS. The course culminates in combining these technical and analytical skills with critical thinking and interpersonal communication through the development and presentation of a research project. The course contributes to the deveopment of competencies that are essential to success in the geospatial workforce.

## Course Objectives and Measurable Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

| Focus | Objective |
