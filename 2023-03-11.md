## Lab exercise
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one
1. [Create a public GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). We'll mostly be using a GitHub Project, but the Repository is necessary for us to leverage Issues in our Project.
    1. You can title your repository anything you like. Please select option to include a README.md but don't worry about a .gitignore or a License. Don't forget to make the repository public.
3. [Create a GitHub Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#creating-a-user-project) in your personal GitHub account to track work for this class and your applied report
    1. Start with an empty project: Select `Board` then click `Create`
4. [Open a new issue in the alex-pakalniskis/gisc606-spring2023 repository](https://github.com/alex-pakalniskis/gisc606-spring2023/issues/new) to tell me about yourself. Answers are visibile to anyone who knows how to read a GitHub Issue so only share what you feel disclosing to the public. 
    1. Please format your response as a Markdown code block with JSON syntax highlighting. 
    2. See [this resource](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) to get started. You can also view the `.md` version of this file to see how I did it below (change the url file ending).
