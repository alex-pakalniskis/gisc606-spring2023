## Lab exercise
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one
1. [Create a GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). We'll mostly be using a GitHub Project, but the Repository is necessary for us to leverage Issues in our Project.
2. [Create a GitHub Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects) to track work for this class and your applied report
    1. Start with an empty project: Select `Board` then click `Create`
4. [Open a new issue in this repo](https://github.com/alex-pakalniskis/gisc606-spring2023/issues/new) to tell me about yourself. 
    1. Please format your response as a code block with JSON syntax highlighting. 
    2. See [this resource](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) to get started. You can also view the `.md` version of this file to see how I did it below (change the url file ending).
