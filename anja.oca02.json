        "your_summary": "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be extremely useful for studying the impacts of vegetation on animal populations. Some of the wags that the NDVI does that is by tracking change sun vegetation, studying trophic inter-linkages, and using NDVI time series to derive ecologically relevant measures. With these uses the NDVI will continue to be a valuable asset for terrestrial ecologists."

        "your_summary": "There have not been any comprehensive reviews of NDVI which is why this paper is using bibliometrics to analyze NDVI research. Bibliometrics allows for one to see global trends of NVDI literature, what can be derived from this trends, and future trends. For this bibliometric study over 17,000 studies were looked at. Overall jr was found that there is a positive trend in the growth of NDVI research, but there still needs to be more exploration done in the future."
