        "your_summary": "They were looking for what thermal bands from Landsat were the best for mapping forest fires. They made a vegetation and temperature index of all of the burn areas. They decided using the bands 4 and 7 were best. They concluded the formula 4-7/4+7 was the best way to map forest fires."

        "your_summary": "The authors monitored fires wildfires around Glacier National Park in 1994. They discovered a way to monitor large and inaccessible fires through remote sensing. This could also be used on small fires, though not cost-effective. They concluded, same as the other authors, that the Normalized Burn ratio formula was best for monitoring fires."
