        "your_summary": "A research team in Valencia, Spain used the Landsat 1 Thematic Mapper sensor to study the recovery period of vegetation after forest fires. The study area, Bunol, experienced three different fires in a six year period which made the location ideal for this analysis. The research team used the spectral signatures and thermal differences to analyze the effects of the forest fires."

        "your_summary": "Researchers at the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey conducted a landscape assessment of several national parks after forest fires using two remote sensing techniques. The first method used Landsat Thematic Mapper data with the Normalized Born Ratio algorithm to measure burn severity. The second method involves hierarchical, multi-layered sampling to calculate the Composite Burn Index. These two techniques allowed the researchers to quantify the effects of forest fires over large periods of time."
