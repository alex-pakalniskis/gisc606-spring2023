        "your_summary": "By comparing burn areas to a reference area that had similar ground makeup of preburnt conditions, the burnt area showed a 5 to 6 degree Celsius increasee about a month or two after the fire. Aroudn two years after, the forest began regeneration, becoming more similar to that vegetation of the original reference area."

        "your_summary": "Burn severity can often be represented in as a single value; however, factors like the types of seed banks present, proximity to those seed banks, climate, soil moisture-holding capacity, etc. can affect the longevity of the burn severity. To assess the fire effects, researchers believe that the extended assessment is more telling, due to allowing time for post-burn recovery. Having multiple reference plots will reduce the frequency of sampling, creating statistical confidence and reaching the main goal of reducing time and effort of the whole process."
