## Course Description
GISC 606 is a graduate-level course designed to introduce the principles and concepts of Earth 
Observation (EO) and EO data applications in ecological and environmental sciences. The 
lectures and readings will cover topics such as contemporary EO systems, electromagnetic 
radiation, EO image processing techniques, and methods of mapping and monitoring terrestrial 
ecosystems. The lectures will also introduce some of the most recent advancements in remote 
sensing methods such as Google Earth Engine and Artificial Intelligence. Weekly laboratory 
sessions will provide hands-on training in basic skills of remote sensing data analysis.

Lab exercise
* Although students are encouraged to work together on lab assignments (either in-person or 
online), each student is responsible for doing and submitting their own independent lab 
assignments. Any submitted work that was copied from another student’s journal or lab submittal 
will receive a grade of zero

Exams
* There will be two exams which together will count for 50% of your grade in this course. The 
exams will assess both conceptual and practical knowledge of the course topics. Exam questions 
will be based on recorded and unrecorded lectures, textbook and other readings, and lab 
assignments. Both exams will be open-book exams, which means you can use all the class 
materials (e.g. textbook, lecture slides, lab instructions, reading materials etc.) and the internet 
(e.g. Google) during the exams
