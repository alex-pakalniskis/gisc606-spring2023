* Assessment of coastal water quality using remote sensing
* Identification and mapping of landslide-prone areas using LiDAR data
* Analysis of urban growth and land use change using remote sensing
* Detection and mapping of oil spills using synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
* Mapping and monitoring of glacier changes using remote sensing
* Estimating crop yields using multispectral remote sensing
* Identification and mapping of invasive species using remote sensing
* Monitoring of coral reef health using hyperspectral remote sensing
* Mapping of snow cover using passive microwave remote sensing
* Detection and mapping of underground water resources using remote sensing
* Assessment of air pollution using remote sensing data
* Detection and mapping of sea ice using synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
* Mapping of mangrove forests using remote sensing
* Detection and mapping of natural gas leaks using airborne remote sensing
* Analysis of water use efficiency in agriculture using remote sensing
* Monitoring and mapping of deforestation using remote sensing
* Estimation of water surface temperature using thermal remote sensing
* Identification and mapping of urban trees using LiDAR data
* Analysis of landslide susceptibility using remote sensing
* Mapping of soil moisture variability using satellite remote sensing
* Monitoring and mapping of wetland inundation using remote sensing
* Detection and mapping of land mines using remote sensing
* Estimation of crop water requirements using remote sensing
* Mapping and analysis of wildfires using thermal remote sensing
* Detection and mapping of shoreline changes using remote sensing

These are just a few examples of potential report topics in applied remote sensing, and there are many more possibilities depending on your interests and the available data.

When selecting a topic, it is important to consider your interests, the availability of data, and the feasibility of the project. You may also want to discuss potential topics with your instructor or colleagues to get feedback and suggestions.


## Project Guidelines
### Word count
1250-1500 words (not including references and appendices)
* Based on assumption that standard formatting of Times New Roman font, 12-point size, double-spaced lines, and 1 inch-margins = 5 pages
* You have wiggle room, but please donâ€™t write a two-page or 20 page length report

### Content

#### I. Introduction
Briefly introduce your specific topic of applied remote sensing and discuss its importance in various fields.

Please share how the topic relates to your personal and/or professional background. 

#### II. Literature Review
Conduct a literature review of the current state of applied remote sensing in your topic of choice.

Please discuss recent advancements in that field and their impact on human, animal, or plant communities. 

You only need to pick one but there are many applications with overlapping impacts so feel free to discuss as your interests dictate

Example: Remote sensing of deforestation. 
Deforestation for agriculture/animal husbandry impacts plant species distribution and human food security in different ways for different people). 

Reference at least 6 peer-reviewed articles and 4 non-academic resources like a government or community organization webpage or blog.

#### III. Methodology
Discuss any notable patterns or trends that emerged from the data.

Focus on a relevant methodology or data product you find during your literature review. 

Provide a detailed explanation of the methodology or data and include information on the equipment and software used (when possible), as well as any known limitations.

#### IV. Discussion
Discuss the implications of your findings and any potential future research directions or applications.

#### VI. Conclusion
Summarize the main findings of your project.
Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered during the project and how they may be addressed in future research.

#### VII. References
List all the references used in the report, following a standard referencing style (your choice, but please remain consistent).

#### VIII. Appendices
Include any supplementary materials such as maps, graphs, or tables that were not included in the main body of the report.

## Deliverable
A [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website with your project content

Please host the page using the repository you created during Lab 0

Use Markdown to format your content for pretty rendering (but feel free to use a word editor like Word, Docs, etc then add Markdown syntax where necessary). You can use this document as a template for content with headings, links, and images (change the url file ending to `.html`)
