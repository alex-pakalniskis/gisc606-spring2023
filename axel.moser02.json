        "your_summary": "The article describes how researchers utilized landsat 5 TM data to analyze burn zones within the Valencia study area in Spain. They determined that the most suitable band lengths to classify burnt areas were between near IR and middle IR as the burnt areas had low reflectance values monitored in the NBR report."

        "your_summary": "The article highlights different research methods to calculate burn intensity and severity. The article goes into detail about different band combinations to capture imagery of Forest Fire areas and calculates risk of severity for burnt areas. Firemon is utilized as well to address issues of scale pertaining to forest fire complexity."
