        "your_summary": "Remote sensing is very useful to apply when mapping forest fires. This paper further shows that by using Landsat 5 data to analyze some forest fire events that have happened. The author clearly explains how they have been able to track the vegetation affected in the regions of the Valencia fires in Spain. They further explain how methods were used to compare and contrast affected areas vs non affected areas surrounding the region. They used the thermal band radiance which proved to be the most effective along with the index to track the recovery of the vegetation over time.  "

        "This article goes into detail on how the Landscape Assessment is used to help determine the impacts a fire can have over affected areas. These areas range can be repeat fire areas extending over wide areas. The focus here is large areas and how they are affected over certain time periods. This is a great way to make connections between the fires, how vegetation is affected and how the terrain plays in the fires that happen. They used the NBR or normalized burn ratio along with remote sensing specifically Landsat imagery during two periods of time. They demonstrate the versatility there is when using Remote sensing you are not just restricted to one way. "
