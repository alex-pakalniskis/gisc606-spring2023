        "your_summary": "The authors demostrated the usefulness of using Thematic Mapper Data in order to minimize the influence of scene-dependent factors (atmospheric, ra-diometric, viewing and topographical effects). This is very interesting in multitemporal studies, such as vegetation monitoring, because time computer can be considerablely reduced."

        "your_summary": "The article titled Landscape Assessment: Ground measure of severity, the Composite Burn Index and Remote sensing of severity, the Normalized Burn Ratio discusses the assessment of severity of forest fires using both ground-based measurements and remote sensing techniques. The authors focus on two measures of severity, the Composite Burn Index (CBI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)."
