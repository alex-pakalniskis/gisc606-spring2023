        "your_summary": "This article explains the mapping process of burn areas in the province of Valencia through thematic mapper data. This location was specifically chosen because it is prone to fire due to its climate. The thermal band and index 4-7/4+7 are suitable to study the burn areas. These same parameter can be used to examine vegetation regeneration in burnt areas."

A detailed summary of the burn area included percent plot area burnt, prefire condtions, and enhenced growth factors. NBR was computed on each Landsat scene, prefire, and postfire. Landscape Assesment included comprehensive instructions relevant to this study.  "
