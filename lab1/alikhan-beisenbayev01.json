        "your_summary": "Thematic Mapper (TM) is used in this article to map fire damage and assess reforestation after forest fires. The first topic of discussion was a new index that helps burn maps; the authors were able to determine the formula for the Burn ratio index using channels 4 and 7, after studying spectral characteristics and applying spatial statistics methods. In addition, a new thermal band was investigated to determine if it could be used to map burn areas. During the tests, it was found that the temperature in the places of burns was 5-6 ° C higher than the reference. For this type of monitoring, the BRI is more suitable, since the values of the thermal range are rapidly decreasing due to the renewal of vegetation, therefore it is ineffective for monitoring reforestation."

        "title": "Landscape Assessment: Remote Sensing of Severity, the Normalized Burn Ratio; and Ground Measure of Severity, the Composite Burn Index.",
        "authors": "Key, C. and N. Benson, N",
        "link": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241687027_Landscape_Assessment_Ground_measure_of_severity_the_Composite_Burn_Index_and_Remote_sensing_of_severity_the_Normalized_Burn_Ratio",
        "your_summary": "The article discusses two distinct techniques for judging the extent of burns in wildfire-damaged landscapes. The Composite Burn Index (CBI), a ground-based measurement, is the first technique and accounts for the level of burn, the amount of consumption, and the death of trees and plants. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), a remote sensing technology that makes use of satellite data to gauge the severity of burns, is the second approach. The authors contrast the two approaches and come to the conclusion that they work well together to provide a more thorough evaluation of burn severity. They also go over the benefits and drawbacks of each technique, arguing that for precise landscape assessments, a mix of ground-based and remote sensing methods is required."
