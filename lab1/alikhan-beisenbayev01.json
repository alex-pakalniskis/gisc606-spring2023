        "your_summary": "The article discusses two distinct techniques for judging the extent of burns in wildfire-damaged landscapes. The Composite Burn Index (CBI), a ground-based measurement, is the first technique and accounts for the level of burn, the amount of consumption, and the death of trees and plants. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), a remote sensing technology that makes use of satellite data to gauge the severity of burns, is the second approach. The authors contrast the two approaches and come to the conclusion that they work well together to provide a more thorough evaluation of burn severity. They also go over the benefits and drawbacks of each technique, arguing that for precise landscape assessments, a mix of ground-based and remote sensing methods is required."
