        "your_summary": "The article discusses two different methods for assessing the severity of burns in landscapes that have experienced wildfires. The first method, the Composite Burn Index (CBI), is a ground-based measurement that takes into account the depth of burn, the degree of consumption, and the mortality of trees and shrubs. The second method, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), is a remote sensing technique that uses satellite imagery to estimate the severity of burns. The authors compare the two methods and conclude that they are complementary and can be used together to provide a more complete assessment of burn severity. They also discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and suggest that a combination of ground-based and remote sensing techniques is necessary for accurate landscape assessments."
