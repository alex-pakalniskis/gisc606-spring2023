        "your_summary": "In this article, data derived from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper was used to conduct environmental analyses in Valencia, Spain. The objective of the study was to map areas of interest that had been burned in forest fires, compare them to a reference image of non-burnt forest, and determine the best bands and vegetation index to use in order to carry out their change over time analysis of how burnt forests in the region regenerate."

        "your_summary": "This chapter reading was a detailed synopsis discussing and defining the Normalized Burn Ratio and the Composite Burn Index, specifically using Landsat 7 data. The chapter describes each of the latter in detail and also discusses best practices and parameters to use from a Landscape Ecology perspective."
