        "your_summary": "This article discusses the possibilities of using the Thematic Mapper instrement on the Landsat satellite to determine whether the observations are suitable for measuring reforrestration after a brush fire. Spectral signatures of vegitation as well as thermal observations were analyzed from the refernce data was compared to test data to make the determinations. The authors conclude that several bands on the Thematic Mapper instrament are suitable to stude the areas ffected by forrest fires."

        "your_summary": "This article discusses the two methodologies, Composite Burn Index (CBI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), when studying the effects of fire on vegitation. The article points out that using the CBI, provides detail at local a local scale, while image analysis using the NBR, illustrates the before and after effects of a fire at a large scale."
