        "your_summary": "Researchers compared two study sites--one unburned area and another area affected by  a forest fire-- to determine the changes in vegetation due to a forest fire."
        "The most uncorrelated bands were used to create a vegetation index that would best show differences in vegetation. The index results in negative values for those areas without vegetation (i.e. regiosn severely affected by burns) and positive values for those with vegetation."

        "your_summary": "Researchers seek to quantify and characterize burn severity on a test site.The composite burn index is one proposed method that essentially averages the amount of burn that has occurred in a pixel."
        "This study contained a physical aspect with a site visit documented by a field form titled 'LA data form' where researchers examined indicators of burning based on several traits of the land they saw there."
        "Through examination of the physical layout of the land a hierarchy was created and used to plot the vegetation types of the study area."
