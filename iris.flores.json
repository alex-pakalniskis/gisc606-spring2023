        "your_summary": "Garcia M. & Casellas V. (2008) research studies areas that have been affected by forest fires in  the province of Valencia, Spain. In addition, the research focuses on monitoring vegetation regeneration on the areas affected by using remote sensing applications. Mapping of  the burned  areas have been acquired by using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper. Their analysis involves using spectral signatures and vegetation indexes that is best suited for the study site. Through statical analysis, they determine that the best VI to both map affected areas and monitor them include the use of Bands TM4 (0.76-0.90) and TM7(2.08-2.35) spectral ranges."

        "your_summary": "In the research article Landscape Assessment by Key C.H & Bensom N.C (2016),,  focus on the need to address landscape assessment over larger areas. They used remotes sensing techniques  to design applicable methods designed  to study large areas that have been affected by fires.  Their research integrates two  methodologies; the Normalized Burn Ratio acquired from pre- and postfire datasets and the used of  Burn Remote Sensing (BR)  determined from 30-meter data acquired from Landsat.  The normalized burn ratio (NBR) is another vegetation index that allows you to visualize burned areas to understand fire severity. NBR = (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR + SWIR) NBR to understand wildfire, you can perform the calculation on a remotely sensed image taken before to the fire and on another after, then calculate the difference between the two. This difference image is called a dNBR. Using these datatypes from two timeframes Key C.H & Bensom N.C (2016) determine wildfire change detection effects over large areas. "
