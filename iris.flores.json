In addition, the research focuses on monitoring vegetation regeneration on the areas affected by using remote sensing applications. Mapping of  the burned  areas have been acquired by using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper. Their analysis involves using spectral signatures and vegetation indexes that is best suited for the study site. Through statical analysis, they determine that the best VI to both map affected areas and monitor them include the use of Bands TM4 (0.76-0.90) and TM7(2.08-2.35) spectral ranges."
