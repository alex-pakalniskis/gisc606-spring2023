        "your_summary": "The city of Valencia Spain has a high risk of fires because of its Mediterranean weather and it is crucial to use remote sensing in these areas. I like how the authors used analysis of spectral signatures because it shows unique patterns of wavelenghts over time around the burnt areas of Valencia.  "

        "your_summary": "This article talks about wildfire damage and its severity by using Composite Burn Index. This involves looking a different levels of damages to trees and soils Another remote sensing method that was used was Normalized Burn Ratio and that uses satellite imagery to measure fires."
